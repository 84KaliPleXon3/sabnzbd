************************  SABnzbd 0.6.15 ************************

What's new:
- Extend OSX menu with troubleshooting options
- Change newzbin URL
- Flag post-processing as failed when files cannot be moved/copied to destination
- Move "locale" construction from Plush skin to Python code.
  Some embedded Linux platforms show unstable behavior with the original construction.
- Add special setting to use "pickle" library instead of cPickle.
  This is needed for some embedded Linux distros (e.g. OpenElec).
- Minor fixes: see changelog.txt
