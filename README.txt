About:
  SABnzbd is an open-source cross-platform binary newsreader.
  It simplifies the process of downloading from Usenet dramatically,
  thanks to its friendly web-based user interface and advanced
  built-in post-processing options that automatically verify, repair,
  extract and clean up posts downloaded from Usenet.
