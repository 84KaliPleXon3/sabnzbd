Upgrading from 0.4.x
\b0\fs26 \
\

\b PLEASE DOWNLOAD YOUR CURRENT QUEUE BEFORE UPGRADING
\b0 \
\
When upgrading from a 0.4.x release such as 0.4.12 your old settings will be kept.\
You will however be given a fresh queue and history. If you have items in your queue\
from the older version of SABnzbd, you can either re-import the nzb files if you kept\
an nzb backup folder, or temporarily go back to 0.4.x until your queue is complete.\
The history is now stored in a better format meaning future upgrades should be backwards\
compatible.\
