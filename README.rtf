The organization of the download queue is different from 0.5.x.\

cannot go back to an older version without losing your queue.\
Also, your sabnzbd.ini file will be upgraded, making it\
incompatible with release 0.5.x\

Upgrading from 0.4.x
\b0\fs26 \
\

\b PLEASE DOWNLOAD YOUR CURRENT QUEUE BEFORE UPGRADING
\b0 \
\
When upgrading from a 0.4.x release such as 0.4.12 your old settings will be kept.\
You will however be given a fresh queue and history. If you have items in your queue\
from the older version of SABnzbd, you can either re-import the nzb files if you kept\
an nzb backup folder, or temporarily go back to 0.4.x until your queue is complete.\
The history is now stored in a better format meaning future upgrades should be backwards\
compatible.\
