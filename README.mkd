Release Notes  -  SABnzbd 2.2.0 Release Candidate 1
=========================================================

NOTE: Due to changes in this release, the queue will be converted when 2.2.0
is started for the first time. Job order, settings and data will be
preserved, but all jobs will be unpaused and URLs that did not finish
fetching before the upgrade will be lost!

## Changes since 2.1.0
